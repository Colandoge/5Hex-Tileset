# 5Hex V1.1g
A MASSIVE tileset mod for Unciv 3.10.13

5Hex is a tileset/retexture mod which replaces all of the existing FantasyHex images and adds many more - including missing stuff from the expansions.

This mod is compatible with the following mods (as of 01.10.2020):
-Civ5 Expansion mod by Red11
-Medieval Civilizations
-Ancient Civilizations

If you find some missing textures - contact me!

------THEORY------
In theory 5Hex had 4 main design principles - and none are being used, because of FantasyHex limitations:

- Forest and Jungle tiles are created out of single trees sprites
- All tiles are created in layers - which with good coding support could reduce the size of the mod by a lot. For example: 5Hex does not need to have a different Trading post tile for each terrain - it uses same Trading post for all tiles (including forests and jungles).
- Units can have multiple and customizable colors patterns - so egyptian pikeman will have some yellow and purple spots on his armor while china pikeman will have green and white.
- Cities can be build out of single buildings, so players can say what buildings and what type of walls are already built in the city just by looking at the sprite.
